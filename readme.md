## [Quick Start](https://cefview.github.io/QCefView/)


QCefView is a Qt based QWidget which encapsulates [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef). With QCefView you can build your application UI in frontend developing way to boost your project. And what's more you can completely decouple the UI and business logic in your project.

**OSR** = Offscreen Rendering Mode 

**NCW** = Native Child Window Mode
### Clone With Submodule
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CefView/QCefView.git
```

# Note For Debugging With xCode

if you want to debug the project with xCode, you need to take some action to make sure the demo project could load CocoaCefView at correct location.

1. Generate project with cmake
2. Build demo project with xcode, do not run (actually you will encounter errors if you run directly)
3. Go to the **Build Phases** for target CocoaCefViewDemo and perform the actions below
    - remove all items under **Target Dependencies**
    - remove all items under **Link Binary With Libraries**
4. Now you can debug demo project in xCode without errors

if you re-generated the project, please remember to re-do the instructions above

## About OSR mode

QCefView supports CEF offscreen rendering mode and this feature is enabled by default at runtime, to disable OSR mode you need to set the config item  setWindowlessRenderingEnabled to false
```cpp
  QCefConfig config;

// WindowlessRenderingEnabled is set to true by default, set to false to disable the OSR mode
 config.setWindowlessRenderingEnabled(false)
 ```

QCefView currently uses Qt Software Rasterizer as the backend paint engine for best compatibility, thus the rendering performance is not so good to be applied for all business scenarios. If you are going to host WegGL games, video sites or some other Web Apps with high rendering performance, Non OSR mode (Native Child Window mode) is recommended.

### Why not OpenGL/DirectX/Metal?

QCefView was designed to be a common Qt widget for Desktop application, so the compatibility is the first important requirement. We can switch the backend engine from Software Rasterizer to OpenGL/DirectX/Metal but this will increase the complexity and decrease the compatibility of QCefView. 

For example if we use OpenGL as the backend engine then all the applications with QCefView introduced will be switched to OpenGL backend automatically. I believe not all users want this to happen. 

DirectX/Metal are platform dependent and they are not supported natively by Qt. If we provide QCefView with extra dependencies individually, this makes QCefView so different with other components in Qt Framework.

But if you must use OSR and the rendering performance is vital, you can try to switch the backend with whatever you want.
